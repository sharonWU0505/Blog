Hi, I'm Sharon. I'm a software engineer from Taipei, Taiwan.

These days I develop large-scale cloud security platform by Angular, Node.js, and PHP. 
I also have much experience on React for building interactive campaign websites and internal administration systems.

In the past few years, I wrote Python and Django. And since then, using Python to boost routine work became one of my interest.

This blog contains my notes for software development, mostly are about web-based products. Feel free to reach to me if you would like to discuss more.
