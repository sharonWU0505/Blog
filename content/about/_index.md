Hi, I'm Sharon. I'm a _software engineer_ from Taipei, Taiwan.

These days I develop large-scale cloud security platform mainly by Angular and PHP. 
I also have much experience on React for building interactive campaign websites and internal administration systems.

In the past few years, I wrote Python and Django. And since then, using Python to boost routine works became one of my interest.

This blog contains my notes for software development, mostly are frontend things. I'm stepping into backend now, so hopefully there'll have more related to it in the future.

Feel free to read and contact me if you would like to discuss more.
